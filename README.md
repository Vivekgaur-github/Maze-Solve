🧠 AI-Based Maze Solver using A* and BFS Algorithms
📋 Project Overview

This project demonstrates Artificial Intelligence pathfinding algorithms — A* (A-Star) and BFS (Breadth-First Search) — through a visual maze-solving simulation.
It visually compares how both algorithms explore the maze, find the optimal path, and differ in efficiency.

The project aims to help students understand AI search strategies, heuristic-based decision-making, and performance tradeoffs between uninformed and informed searches.

🚀 Features

🧩 Random maze generation

🔍 BFS Algorithm: Explores all paths level by level (uninformed search)

⚡ A* Algorithm: Uses heuristics for efficient and optimal pathfinding

🎨 Real-time visualization of visited nodes and final path

🔁 Reset and re-run options for testing multiple mazes

📱 Responsive and minimal UI design
